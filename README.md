🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning


This project implements a machine learning model to predict rainfall based on weather-related parameters. It aims to assist in planning and preparedness by providing accurate rainfall forecasts using historical weather data.

📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood and amount of rainfall using supervised learning techniques. This can be useful in sectors like agriculture, disaster management, and environmental monitoring.

🚀 Features
🌦️ Predicts Rainfall: Based on features like temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, etc.

📊 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data.

🤖 Trained ML Models: Uses models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.

📈 Model Evaluation: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

📉 Data Visualization: Correlation matrix, feature distributions, rainfall trends.

💡 Future Scope: Can be enhanced using deep learning, real-time APIs, and geolocation data.
